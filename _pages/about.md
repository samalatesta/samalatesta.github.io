I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the Boston University Clinical HIV/AIDS Research Training Program at Boston Medical Center. I earned my PhD in Biostatistics from Boston University, where my doctoral work focused on developing statistical methods to better understand tuberculosis (TB) disease dynamics among key populations.

My research sits at the intersection of statistical methods, infectious diseases, and global health, bridging methodological innovation with applied data analysis. I develop new tools and modeling approaches to answer pressing public health questions while ensuring accessibility through open-source software.

My current work focuses on applying diverse modeling techniques to study TB transmission and developing statistical methods that integrate pathogen whole-genome sequencing with individual-level clinical data.

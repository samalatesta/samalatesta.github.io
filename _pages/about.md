I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the Boston University Clinical HIV/AIDS Research Training Program at Boston Medical Center. I earned my PhD in Biostatistics from Boston University, where my doctoral work focused on developing statistical methods to better understand tuberculosis (TB) disease dynamics among key populations. My current work focuses on applying diverse modeling techniques to study TB transmission and developing statistical methods that integrate pathogen whole-genome sequencing with individual-level clinical data.

### Research Interests  

My research sits at the intersection of **biostatistics**, **infectious disease epidemiology**, and **global health**.  
I am particularly interested in:  

- Developing **statistical methods** for **integrating diverse data sources**, including genomic, clinical, and surveillance data.  
- Applying **modeling techniques** such as phylodynamics and transmission models to understand the spread of infectious diseases.  
- Using these methods to study **tuberculosis**, with the goal of informing prevention and control strategies.
